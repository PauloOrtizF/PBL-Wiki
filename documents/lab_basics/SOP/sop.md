# Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)
The Predictive Brain Lab has adopted standarized procedures for designing experiments and processing data for several years now. The employment of **standard operating procedures (SOP)** has three main advantages over individualized pipelines:
1. They provide new lab members with easily understandable and expandable templates for their research
2. They facilitate the exchange of data amongst lab members and external parties by establishing a common structure.
3. Standarized approaches facilitates the comparison of effects between different experiments.

In the following section, we will outline the general SOP. Over time, as all members adhere to these guidelines, the procedures will become more specific. Typically, these guidelines will be concise and direct you to detailed information about the aspects discussed on the [Donders Intranet Resources](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=1).
