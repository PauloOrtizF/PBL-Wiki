## Preregistration
For the Predictive Lab's stance on Open Science practices and preregistration please refer to our [handbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KwMbSAT4MfGEZaZtAyrChnOH4KTHIkmy/view)
In the lab we use two different platforms to preregister our studies:
1. [As Predicted](https://aspredicted.org/)
2. [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/)

with **As Predicted** following a specific structure and **OSF** providing more freedom to your structure. 

The current page provides you with guidance on the information you might want to include in your pre-registration document: 

1. The title of your project.
2. Whether any data have been collected for the study already.
3. The research questions and the hypotheses.
- What are the questions you want to answer with the current study?
- What are your hypotheses?
4. The variables and conditions in your study
- What is the dependent variable?
- What are the independent variables?
- What conditions do you have?
- Is the design event-related or blockwise (for fMRI studies)
5. Primary analyses
- What are the most important analyses you are going to perform?
- How are you going to perform these analyses?
- On which effects are you focusing to answer your main questions?
- How are you going to define your ROIs (for fMRI studies)?
6. Secondary analyses
- What other analyses are you going to perform?
7. Sample size
- How many participants will you test?
- How do you justify this sample size? (see also your PPM)
8. Quality check of your data
- How do you determine whether the data quality is good?
- When will you exclude a participant?
- i.e. if they missed more than â€¦% of all trials.
- i.e. if they showed excessive motion during scanning.
9. Other
- Are there any other aspects of the study you would like to preregister?
