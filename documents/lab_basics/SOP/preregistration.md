## Preregistration and Reproducibility
For the Predictive Lab's stance on Open Science practices and preregistration please refer to our [handbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RMTpcPl8lwJ6Ozf3QIlTaehedsL_tSUC/view)

Any project analysis script should be easily reproducible by other lab members or external parties. Hence, we try to always write code with the assumption that someone else will have to reproduce it without assistance. If you require a nudge on how to organize your code, look at [the writing code section]({% link documents/technical-help/software/reproducible_code.md %}) of the wiki on efficient coding practices. 

The research data for members of the DCCN should be findable and accessible. This can largely be achieved by actively archiving and publishing data via the Radboud Data Repository (RDR), under an appropriate license and access level, and by annotating the data with rich metadata. A major goal of the Donders Institute is to preserve and share research data for the long term. Hence, every researcher at the DCCN is nudged to make their data publicly available ([exceptions exist](https://www.ru.nl/rdm/vm/policy-documents/)). 

The regulations on Research Data Management from the Radboud University can be found [here](https://www.ru.nl/rdm/vm/policy-documents/) and those specific for members of the DCCN [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=6467).







# Preregistration


In the lab we use two different platforms to preregister our studies:
1. [As Predicted](https://aspredicted.org/)
2. [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/)

with **As Predicted** following a specific structure and **OSF** providing more freedom to your structure. 

The current page provides you with guidance on the information you might want to include in your pre-registration document: 

1. The title of your project.
2. Whether any data have been collected for the study already.
3. The research questions and the hypotheses.
- What are the questions you want to answer with the current study?
- What are your hypotheses?
4. The variables and conditions in your study
- What is the dependent variable?
- What are the independent variables?
- What conditions do you have?
- Is the design event-related or blockwise (for fMRI studies)
5. Primary analyses
- What are the most important analyses you are going to perform?
- How are you going to perform these analyses?
- On which effects are you focusing to answer your main questions?
- How are you going to define your ROIs (for fMRI studies)?
6. Secondary analyses
- What other analyses are you going to perform?
7. Sample size
- How many participants will you test?
- How do you justify this sample size? (see also your PPM)
8. Quality check of your data
- How do you determine whether the data quality is good?
- When will you exclude a participant?
- i.e. if they missed more than â€¦% of all trials.
- i.e. if they showed excessive motion during scanning.
9. Other
- Are there any other aspects of the study you would like to preregister?
