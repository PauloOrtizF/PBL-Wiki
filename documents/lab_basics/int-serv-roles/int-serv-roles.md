# Internal Service Roles (Guidelines)

As part of the Predictive Brain Lab, various roles need to be fulfilled to ensure a lively and stimulating lab experience. These roles involve the organization of the (digital) resources and group activities. In this section of the WIKI we will provide some guidelines on the responsibilities linked to each position.
