# Wiki, Website and Handbook

One of the internal services roles that can be taken as a member of the Predictive Brain Lab is the one to maintain the website, the lab's handbook and the wiki (what you are reading now)

#### Things to Know
In order to be able to access all of these resources as an account owner you will need to request access to the lab's account. This can be requested from Floris directly or the person that was previously in charge of the role.

> In order to access all of the accounts, you need to be connected to the EduVPN. Otherwise, it will ask you for authentication
