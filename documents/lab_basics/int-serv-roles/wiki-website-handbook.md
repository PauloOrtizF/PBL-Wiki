# Wiki, Website and Handbook

One of the internal services roles as a member of the Predictive Brain Lab is the one to maintain the website, the lab's handbook and the wiki (what you are reading now)

#### Necessary Steps
In order to be able to access all of these resources as an account owner you will need to request access to the lab's account. This can be requested from Floris directly or the person that was previously in charge of the role. 

{: .note}
> In order to access all of the accounts, you need to be connected to the EduVPN. Otherwise, it will ask you for authentication of the accounts

### Wiki
The management of the wiki should be relatively straightforward. The important thing you need to be familiar with is how to use GitHub. If you are taking this role, it is assumed you must have this knowledge. However, if this is not the case, you can look at the [GitHub resources]({% link documents/technical-help/software/reproducible_code.md %}) in the wiki and get up to speed! 

You will be responsible to:

1. Update the knowledge contained
  1. Adding input from other lab members in the forms of requests (in Github)
  2. Adding information mentioned during any lab meeting that might be relevant
  3. Filling a gap of knowledge on information that is useful for everyone at the lab

2. Be sure that the page is still working and everyone in the lab (old and new members) have access to the information.

It is recommended to set specific date(s) during the time you are responsible for the maintenance of the wiki to ensure all the information is still relevant. There are certain factors that might be changing at the insitute make certain pages obsolte. In order for the wiki not to die (like previous attempts) it is important to make this a useful resource. Hence, you should also:

* Schedule a **general lab meeting to discuss how often people use this resoruce and how can we increase its usage**

### Website

Similar to the wiki, you will need access to the lab's account to be able to edit the website. You will find everything you need to know about the website on the Drive of the account. 

Your role as a website manager consists of the following tasks:
- Make sure you update the profiles of the lab members if there are any new members/members leaving/requests for change (these will be received in the form of email)
- Make sure you are keeping up to date uploading photos from social activities/outings
- Make sure you are adding information about important events happening at the lab in the Social & News tab
- Make sure that all the links on the website are currenlty working
- If there are changes to the members of the lab, it is a good idea to take a new group picture during the Lab Retreat.
- You should keep an alert of any new publications happening at the lab (you can add an alert with Floris' name on google scholar)
- You should add a button to the home screen advertising a position if one becomes available

For the management of the website, you can discuss with Floris is there are any specific tasks he would like you to get done or NOT to do. 

### Handbook 

The handbook is a collective effort from the members of the Predictive Brain Lab to put in paper all the values, norms and expectations from everyone that joins the lab. 

A part of your responsibility with your service role is to see that all the information present in the handbook is up to date with the norms that have been established in the lab. These tend to be dynamic which means that the information that has been written there can get outdated very quickly. Additionally, it is not just the norms but also the links or specific resoruces that might stop working at any point for various reasons. Your work is to make sure the document stays up to date and everything associated with it keeps working. 

#### How do you do this?

- make a check every once in a while
- check the documents shared in the lab
- make edits on it and remember to udpate the name
- share with group
