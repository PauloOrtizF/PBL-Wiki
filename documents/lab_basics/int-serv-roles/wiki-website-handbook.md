# Wiki, Website and Handbook

One of the internal services roles as a member of the Predictive Brain Lab is the one to maintain the website, the lab's handbook and the wiki (what you are reading now)

#### Necessary Steps
In order to be able to access all of these resources as an account owner you will need to request access to the lab's account. This can be requested from Floris directly or the person that was previously in charge of the role. 

{: .note}
> In order to access all of the accounts, you need to be connected to the EduVPN. Otherwise, it will ask you for authentication of the accounts

### Wiki
The management of the wiki should be relatively straightforward. The important thing you need to be familiar with is how to use GitHub. If you are taking this role, it is assumed you must have this knowledge. However, if this is not the case, you can look at the [GitHub resources]({% link documents/technical-help/software/reproducible_code.md %}) in the wiki and get up to speed! 

You will be responsible to:

1. Update the knowledge contained
  1. Adding input from other lab members in the forms of requests (in Github)
  2. Adding information mentioned during any lab meeting that might be relevant
  3. Filling a gap of knowledge on information that is useful for everyone at the lab

2. Be sure that the page is still working and everyone in the lab (old and new members) have access to the information.

It is recommended to set specific date(s) during the time you are responsible for the maintenance of the wiki to ensure all the information is still relevant. There are certain factors that might be changing at the insitute make certain pages obsolte. In order for the wiki not to die (like previous attempts) it is important to make this a useful resource. Hence, you should also:

* Schedule a **general lab meeting to discuss how often people use this resoruce and how can we increase its usage**
