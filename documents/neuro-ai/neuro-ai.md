# Neuro-AI

This section provides useful information on resources and techniques for projects that have a more Neuro-AI focus. Over the last years, a big part of the lab has been focusing on projects that lie at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, hence it seemed suiting to have a page dedicated to resources that can get you up to speed with some of this knowledge. 

The page will mostly be focused on resources as it is hard to cover these nuanced techniques, but hopefully it will provide you with a good starting point.
