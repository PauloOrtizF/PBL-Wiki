# Neuro-AI Resources
This page will try to highlight  resources that can be very helpful if you are trying to get up to speed in the field of NeuroAI. Some of them might be more focused on the AI side of things while others will be directly tailored towards the combination of both.

#### Before Starting
The resources mentioned here assume that you have neuroscience knowledge and programming knowledge. It is very unlikely that you will not know about neuroscience, however, if for some reason your background is purely a Machine Learning one, check out this resource:
*

Additionally, if your programming knowledge is not as strong as you wish, check out the [Programming Section]({% link documents/technical-help/software/programming_languages.md %}) of the wiki and focus on Python.

The resources you should know before starting to work with NeuroAI are the following:
- Python Programming
    - Specifically, try to learn about [Object Oriented Programming](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/python-oop-tutorial)
- Linear Alegbra (check the [Stats & Maths]({% link documents/technical-help/maths-and-stats/ section
