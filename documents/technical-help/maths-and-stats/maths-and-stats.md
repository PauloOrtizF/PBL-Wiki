# Mathematical and Statistical Resources
Statistical and mathematical analysis lay at the core of most of the work we produce as neuroscientists. Hence, it is not a surpirse that since undergraduate training there is an emphasis in properly understanding concepts from these two disciplines. However, it still happens that we come across new analysis or methods that require us to expand our mathematical knowledge. Lucky for us, the internet is full of great tutorials that can help us fill these gaps in knowledge. 

The current page provides a bunch of resources we think are very useful to learn some of these skills:

## Statistics 

### Frequentist
* [Discovering Statistics Using R (Andy Field)](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/discovering-statistics-using-r/book236067) - There is probably not a better book to learn the core statistical analysis performed in Psychology than Andy Field's book. Clear explanations together with exercises that will ensure you master all these skills in no time. 

* [Multivariate analysis for the behavioral sciences (Vehkalahti)](https://www.routledge.com/Multivariate-Analysis-for-the-Behavioral-Sciences-Second-Edition/Vehkalahti-Everitt/p/book/9780367656751) - Taking it a step further. The book covers statistical concepts more in depth, providing you with the necessary knowledge to flexible adjust these concepts to your own analysis. It requires familiarity with statistical analysis to be understood. 

### Bayesian
* [A Studentâ€™s Guide to Bayesian Statistics (Lambert)](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/EM20/Lambert.pdf) - If you are looking for expanding your knowledge of other than frequentist statistics, this book is the perfect way to start. Providing a great introduction to Bayesian statistics.
  * [Bayesian Inference from the Ground Up: A Theory of Common Sense](https://www.bayesianspectacles.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Bayesian_Inference_From_The_Ground_Up_draft.pdf)   

* [JASP Tutorials](https://jasp-stats.org/resources/) - JASP is a statistical analysis software focused on allowing you to do Bayesian statistics in an intuitive easy fashion. The creators of it, provide multiple explanations and tutorials on the different types of Bayesian (and frequentist) analysis you can perform. It is also a great starting point if you are not looking to completely master Bayesian statistics.

### Good Old Machine Learning

* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) - This book provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. **Highly recommended**. They also have a version for applications in R and a version for Python.
  * [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf) - If you are mathematical savvy and want to dive deeper into the underlying mathematical equations behind some of the algorithms mentioned in the previous book, the same authors created a more advanced version of it to get the nitty gritty of what goes behind every statistical technique you use.

 * [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-45528-0) - If you want to go even a step further, this is considered by many (especially in the AI field) as the best introduction to machine learning. It does require you to have a good mathematical foundation. Hence, if you want to dive into the field but not feel yet fully confident, we recommend trying one of the other two alternatives.
