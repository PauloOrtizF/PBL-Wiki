# Summer Schools

Attending summer school(s) as a researcher can significantly contribute to your academic and professional development, providing you with advanced skills, valuable networks, and new perspectives that can enhance your research and career prospects.

These are events that allow for highly specialized knowledge to be acquired in a short amount of time. Their intensive nature allows you to completely dive in a topic without getting distrcted by the regular meetings or events happening at the DCCN. Additionally, most of the time experts on the field get together to instruct on these topics, making it a unique opportunity to learn and connect with new researchers. 

The list provided here is quite brief and should be extended/modified according to the interests of the lab:
