# Code, Analysis and Computing

This section will provide you with useful information on resources and tools you can use for programming and analyzing data. The focus will be on providing an overview of important general purpose software that lies at the core of a lot of the analysis and work done by the members of the Predictive Brain Lab. 

## Software

### Python
Python is a general-purpose, open-source programming language known for its simple syntax, easy readability, and efficient commands. It has become the standard in most technical fields, including deep learning, due to its advanced capabilities. 

For researchers, Python simplifies complex tasks like visualizations, machine learning, and statistical analysis, often requiring only a few lines of code with the right package. 

Additionally, learning Python is easy, especially for those already proficient in another programming language.

#### Starting with Python 

If you have never seen or used Python, we will provide you with useful resources to get you up to speed. This will avoid you getting stuck or learning bad coding practices. Once you are familiar with data types, looping, functions, modules and especially `numpy`, you should be ready to 'hit the streets'.

Interactive resources online are one of the best ways of learning Python as they teach you with a hands-on approach.  However, some of these require you to pay, which is not always ideal. Hence, we will highlight both payed and free resources for you.

* [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/) - Amazing resource full of tutorials and lectures that provide a comprehensive understanding of Python as well as specialized courses that might be useful for you as a researcher.

> Some people in the lab have free access to DataCamp. You can ask around to see whether they can provide you with this free access. 

* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) - Very similar to Data Camp with the difference that some of their courses are given for free.

* [Lab in Cognition and Perception (Todd Gureckis)](https://teaching.gureckislab.org/spring24/labincp/intro.html) - A nice resource tailored to learning Python from scratch and applying it to neuroscience. If you are just looking to purely learn Python, this is NOT the resource for you as it also include theoretical information about the brain.

* [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) - This digital book is a detailed and amazing resource created by Jake VanderPlas. It provides very comprehensive explanations that will ensure a strong programming foundation.

* Learn Python 3 The Hard Way (Zed Shaw) - This book is a perfect introductory text that, despite its name, will get you up to speed in no time.

> You can find the PDF for the book online by typing the title + PDF

* [Introduction to Programming in Python](https://www.ru.nl/en/education/education-for-professionals/overview/introduction-to-programming-in-python-rss0002-closed) - The Radboud University offers a **five-day introduction to Programming in Python course** designed for social scientists - with zero experience in programming - who would like to conduct data collection, analysis, and modelling with Python.

##### Not a Beginner?
* [Python for Neuroscientists (Tomas Knappen)](https://github.com/tknapen/python_workshop-Basel/tree/master) - This series of Python tutorials is directed towards neuroscientists and can serve to refresh your knowledge of some Python commands. 

* [Python Research Masters Course (Lukas Snoek)](https://lukas-snoek.com/introPy/index.html) - This is a course designed by Lukas Snoek for Research Masters students from the University of Amsterdam that assumes basic knowledge of programming languagues. It is directed towards behavioral sciences and includes a module of programming in [Psychopy](https://www.psychopy.org/)


#### How to use Python?
As with any other programming language, you can only really learn it by using it. Therefore, by far the easiest way to learn Python is to choose a new project and plan up front to do this entire project (or at least a part of it, like all fMRI-analysis) in Python - and stick with it.  

We recommend to postpone your learning until you will start using Python for your work. Even when you use some of the resources highlighted above, all the time might be wasted if you do not use the things you have learned consistently. 

#### Python's Organization
Python is not an all-in-one product. At its core it is a programming language, which comes in different versions (Python 2 and 3). There are different distributions, which contain the pure language in addition to a lot of packages (these are like toolboxes for different needs you might have). Becase Python is open source and not centrally planned, these different distributions might have different ways of updating and maintaining them. 

Additionally, Python does not come with a programming environment. This means you need to make use of a interactive development environment (IDE) or a code editor to use it. 

All these options can be overwhelming to a beginner. Hence, we always recommend reading a little bit about Python before starting. You can see [here](https://github.com/swc-pyclub/pystarters/tree/master/topic_1_interactive_python) for an  easy introduction. 

In general, our recommendations are:

* Install Python with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) as a distribution
* Use virtual environments to maintain dependencies.
* Use conda to manage packages â€” or pip but only use pip *in a virtual environment*.
* Use one of the following IDEs for programming:
  * [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/?source=google&medium=cpc&campaign=EMEA_en_NL_PyCharm_Branded&term=pycharm&content=698987581422&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwvIWzBhAlEiwAHHWgvTa8eQkxFxhaniSEJ8J9yk2YYQOQKSi1kvFbF1WoaJJhEzuRS7ocHRoCOh0QAvD_BwE) - Great tool and widely used. Not the default if your laptop has low RAM Memory.
  * [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Easy to use, can be used in the cluster directly, suitable for laptops with limited memory.
  * [Jupyter notebooks or JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) - Not the first recommendation, but you might already be familiar with them
