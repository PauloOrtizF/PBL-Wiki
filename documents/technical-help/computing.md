# Code, Analysis and Computing

This section will provide you with useful information on resources and tools you can use for programming and analyzing data. The focus will be on providing an overview of important general purpose software that lies at the core of a lot of the analysis and work done by the members of the Predictive Brain Lab. 

## Software

### Python
Python is a general-purpose and open source programming language. Its syntax is very simple, has easy code readibilitiy and its commands are efficient. Hence, it is not surprising that is has become, outside academia and in most technical fields, the standard. Not knowing Python means not having access to some of the most modern and advanced techniques available (_e.g.,_ most deep learning implementations happen in this language).

Python is a great programming language for researchers as it tends to make difficult things (visualizations, machine learning, statistical analysis, etc.) much easier. Often, even the most sophisticated things can be done by simply finding the right package, and writing just a few lines of code.

Also, learning python is easy! If you are already proficient in a different programming language transitioning should be straightforward!

#### Starting with Python 

If you have never seen or used Python, we will provide you with useful resources to get you up to speed. This will avoid you getting stuck or learning bad coding practices. Once you are familiar with datatypes, looping, functions, modules and especially numpy, you should be ready to 'hit the streets'.

Interactive resources online are one of the best ways of learning Python as they teach you with a hands-on approach.  However, some of these require you to pay, which is not always ideal. Hence, we will highlight both payed and free resources for you.

* [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/) - Amazing resource full of tutorials and lectures that provide a comprehensive understanding of Python as well as specialized courses that might be useful for you as a researcher.

> Some people in the lab have free access to DataCamp. You can ask around to see whether they can provide you with this free access. 

* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) - Very similar to Data Camp with the difference that some of their courses are given for free.

* [Lab in Cognition and Perception (Todd Gureckis)](https://teaching.gureckislab.org/spring24/labincp/intro.html) - A nice resource tailored to learning Python from scratch and applying it to neuroscience. If you are just looking to purely learn Python, this is NOT the resource for you as it also include theoretical information about the brain.

* [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) - This digital book is a detailed and amazing resource created by Jake VanderPlas. It provides very comprehensive explanations that will ensure a strong programming foundation.

* Learn Python 3 The Hard Way (Zed Shaw) - This book is a perfect introductory text that, despite its name, will get you up to speed in no time.

> You can find the PDF for the book online by typing the title + PDF

* [Introduction to Programming in Python](https://www.ru.nl/en/education/education-for-professionals/overview/introduction-to-programming-in-python-rss0002-closed) - The Radboud University offers a **five-day introduction to Programming in Python course** designed for social scientists - with zero experience in programming - who would like to conduct data collection, analysis, and modelling with Python.

##### Not a Beginner?
* [Python for Neuroscientists (Tomas Knappen)](https://github.com/tknapen/python_workshop-Basel/tree/master) - This series of Python tutorials is directed towards neuroscientists and can serve to refresh your knowledge of some Python commands. 

* [Python Research Masters Course (Lukas Snoek)](https://lukas-snoek.com/introPy/index.html) - This is a course designed by Lukas Snoek for Research Masters students from the University of Amsterdam that assumes basic knowledge of programming languagues. It is directed towards behavioral sciences and includes a module of **programming in Psychopy**
