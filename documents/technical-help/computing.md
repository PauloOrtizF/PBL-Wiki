# Code, Analysis and Computing

This section will provide you with useful information on resources and tools you can use for programming and analyzing data. The focus will be on providing an overview of important general purpose software that lies at the core of a lot of the analysis and work done by the members of the Predictive Brain Lab. 

## Software

### Python
Python is a general-purpose and open source programming language. Its syntax is very simple, has easy code readibilitiy and its commands are efficient. Hence, it is not surprising that is has become, outside academia and in most technical fields, the standard. Not knowing Python means not having access to some of the most modern and advanced techniques available (_e.g.,_ most deep learning implementations happen in this language).

Python is a great programming language for researches as it tends to make difficult things (visualizations, machine learning, statistical analysis, etc.) much easier. Often, even the most sophisticated things can be done by simply finding the right package, and writing just a few lines of code.

Also, learning python is easy! If you are already proficient in a different programming language transitioning should be straightforward!
