# MEG Measurement Checklist
The documents below offer a template outlining the necessary steps to set-up and complete an MEG measurement session at the DCCN.
Feel free to take one of the templates below and adapt it according to your needs and those of your study. 
Even if you are familiar with this type of analysis, we recommend following a checklist just to ensure everything goes as smoothly as possible.
