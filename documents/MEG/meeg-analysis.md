# M/EEG Analysis

This section will provide you with information and resources to perform M/EEG analysis. We will mostly explain the different analysis commonly performed by lab members and the available software you can use for tme. 

The main software used by the members of the Predictive Brain Lab to do M/EEG analysis is the following:
* [FieldTrip](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/) - **MATLAB** software toolbox for MEG, EEG and iEEG analysis. This is the **default** software being used given that it is developed at the Donders and they provide support for it.
* [MNE](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html#) - Open-source **Python** package for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing human neurophysiological data: MEG, EEG, sEEG, ECoG, NIRS, and more
* [EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php) - EEGLAB is an interactive **Matlab** toolbox for processing continuous and event-related EEG, MEG and other electrophysiological data

> You can ask other lab members if they have pro's and con's regarding their software selection before deciding what to use. It may be the case that specific software is better for some analysis compared to others.
