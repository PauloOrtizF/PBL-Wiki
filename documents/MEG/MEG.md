This section provides useful information into conducting EEG and MEG experiments as a member of the Predictive Brain Lab. The essential and most important information about performing MEG experiments at the DCCN can be found on the [Intranet website](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=meg-lab). Remember to always read all the information provided by the insitute, as practices may differ from your previous MEG experiences.

In our lab, EEG is a less popular technique, however we will still provide some useful starting points in case you want to make use of it. This [page](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=eeg-labs) of the Intranet contains all the most important information about EEG at the DCCN. Remember to look at it carefully even if you are familiar with this type of analysis. 


This page of the wiki provides a concise summary of guidelines for performing an MEG or EEG experiment, along with tips and tricks for data analysis and references to useful resources.
