# Behavioural Testing Software

There is a variety of software being used to create experiments for neuroscience. Most of the time, you will  likely use the same programs that you were taught during your time as a graduate student of PhD candidate. In the Predictive Brain Lab, we predominantly make use of two programs:

1. [Pyschtoolbox](http://psychtoolbox.org/) - free set of MATLAB functions to create neuroscience experiments. Most members of the lab use this and can provide you with help if needed. 
This [webiste](https://peterscarfe.com/ptbtutorials.html) contains a variety of tutorials to get familiar with coding different types of experimental paradigms. 

2. [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org/) - free set of Pyhton functions to create psychological and neuroscience experiments. A few members of the lab are familiar with this software and can give help if needed. 
The PsychoPy [website](https://psychopy.org/documentation.html) contains tutorials and open source code you can look at to get inspired. 

_**Before starting to code ANY experiment**. Check the compatibility of the software you are planning to use with the Donders Institute computers. The neuroimaging laboratories do not support all software options_

#### Other software options
There are other software options to create your own experiments. These are also popular and you might be familiar with them. Nonetheless, we recommend using one of the two above.
* [Open Sesame](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/) - A user-friendly interface to create your own psychological experiments
* [Presentation](https://www.neurobs.com/) - A Windows owned program for stimulus delivery and experiment control for neuroscience
