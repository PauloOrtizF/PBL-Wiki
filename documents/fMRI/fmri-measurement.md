# fMRI Measurement Checklist

{: .important }
>  If you are not a certified user for fMRI, you need to contact the lab manager and ask how to get certified. In this way you can collect data independently. The individual responsible for the fMRI lab is [Paul Gaalman](https://www.ru.nl/personen/gaalman-p)


The two documents below offer a template outlining the steps necessary to set-up and complete an fMRI measurement session. You can utilize one of the template documents and adapt it to suit the requirements of your own experiment. Even if you are familiar with fMRI measurements, we always recommend having the checklist at hand. The extensive checklist version contains information for EyeTracker usage in case you are making use of this tool in your experimental set-up.

>  Remember to always follow the general guidelines of data management of the Donders Institute. This is especially important for reproducibility in neuroimaging experiments and sharing your results with other lab members.
