# 7T Essen fMRI

{: .important }
> There is no available information on the intranet regarding the 7T scanner in Essen. The information presented here is the one compiled in the old lab wiki. Hence, it might be outdated.

### Completely New?
- Contact between Essen & Donders is not very formalized. It is best to contact someone who scans there and join for one session to get to know the important players.
- In addition, contact [Oliver Kraff](https://www.hahn-institut.de/de/ueber/team/kraff-oliver)(Researcher in Essen) and [Peter Koopmans](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/peter-koopmans/) with short introduction of yourself and your project.

## Organization
### Security 
- Familiarize yourself with 3T security
- Get security training (_see below_)
