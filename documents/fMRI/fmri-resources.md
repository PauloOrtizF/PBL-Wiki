# fMRI Resources

The following section will provide with useful resources when starting with fMRI analyses. Mostly, links to tutorials, lectures and relevant software for the different analysis.

If you are completely unfamiliar with fMRI analysis, a great starter point is the book by Poldrack, Mumford and Nichols - [Handbook of Functional fMRI Analysis](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/handbook-of-functional-mri-data-analysis/8EDF966C65811FCCC306F7C916228529). It provides thorough explanations concerning all the steps necessary to process this type of data. 
You might be able to find this online or checking the Radboud University Library.

One of the authors of this book, [Jeanette Mumford](https://jeanettemumford.org/), has also made a video lecture series covering a wide of topics regarding the analysis of fMRI data. They provide intuitive easy to follow explanations for how fMRI analysis work. You can find her channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/mumfordbrainstats/videos). It is recommended to have a basic level of linear algebra to follow. 

Another video lecture series that has now been transformed into a Coursera Course by Martin Lindquist and Tor Wager can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/@principlesoffmri6920). The link for the Coursera crash course is [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/functional-mri?source=deprecated_spark_cdp)

## Specific Resources

If what you are looking for concerns more specific topics, we also have a series of resources for you. 

[Design Efficiency in fMRI](https://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/DesignEfficiency) - This page addresses the question of how to design fMRI experiments that are sensitive to a specific hypothesis.
