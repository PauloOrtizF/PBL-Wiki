# fMRI Resources

The following section will provide with useful resources when starting with fMRI analyses. Mostly, links to tutorials, lectures and relevant software for the different analysis.

If you are completely unfamiliar with fMRI analysis, a **great starter point is the book by Poldrack, Mumford and Nichols - [Handbook of Functional fMRI Analysis]**(https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/handbook-of-functional-mri-data-analysis/8EDF966C65811FCCC306F7C916228529). It provides thorough explanations concerning all the steps necessary to process this type of data. 
You might be able to find this online or checking the Radboud University Library.

One of the authors of this book, **[Jeanette Mumford](https://jeanettemumford.org/), has also made a video lecture series** covering a wide of topics regarding the analysis of fMRI data. They provide intuitive easy to follow explanations for how fMRI analysis work. You can find her channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/mumfordbrainstats/videos). It is recommended to have a basic level of linear algebra to follow her explanations. 

Another **video lecture series** that has now been transformed into a Coursera Course by Martin Lindquist and Tor Wager can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/@principlesoffmri6920). The link for the Coursera crash course is [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/functional-mri?source=deprecated_spark_cdp)

**[FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki) is a comprehensive library of analysis tools for FMRI**, MRI and diffusion brain imaging data. The creators of this library often offer an **[in-person course]**(https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/fslcourse/website/index.html) on how to use it. However, more relevant for us, they also have the materials and lectures for this **[course online]**(https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/fslcourse/website/online_materials.html). For almost all studies the following tutorials of the 2018 Course are useful: (1) Brain Extraction, Registration, Motion Correction and EPI Distortion. (3) FMRI Preprocessing and Model-Based Analysis.
In case you have any questions, they also have their own [WIKI](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki). Lastly, Jeanette Mumford also has a series of Youtube videos for [FSL for task MRI](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2iAtgpI4YHlH4sno3i3CUjCofI38a-3).


## Specific Resources

**[Design Efficiency in fMRI]**(https://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/DesignEfficiency) - This page addresses the question of how to design fMRI experiments that are sensitive to a specific hypothesis.
